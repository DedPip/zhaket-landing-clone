# zhaket-landing-clone

This project is a **frontend clone** of the landing page template from [Zhaket](https://www.zhaket.com) — specifically the ["Haft Shanbe Bazar" HTML landing template demo](https://www.zhaket.com/web/haft-shanbe-bazar-html-landing-template/demo).

The purpose of this clone was to practice and demonstrate frontend skills in **HTML** and **CSS**. The layout, styles, and responsive behavior of the original landing page were carefully replicated without relying on the original source code.  

P. S. the browser **Inspect tools** have been used to look at how the original page was structured for inspiration, not to copy the code — all the HTML and CSS here was written by hand.
